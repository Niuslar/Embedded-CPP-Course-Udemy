# Embedded C++ Udemy Course

This repo holds the progress of the Udemy Course [Embedded Software Development Using C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-software-development-using-cpp). 

After feeling comfortable programming Embedded Systems using C, I decided to learn more about Object Oriented Programming and C++.  

The course uses Keil uVision 5 as the IDE, but I chose to stick to the STM32 Cube IDE. Because of this I didn't follow the content of the course to the letter.
